Team Contract

Prompt: *Write your Team Contract in a single file, CONTRACT.md, that describes your team work goals and responsibilities. Start by defining a Team Contract, like the one given for the previous projects, that negotiates the communication goals, identifies the quality of work everyone wishes to achieve, and the level of group participation and individual accountability everyone feels comfortable with (here are some guidelines). Each member of the team must sign the completed Team Contract written in this document.*

As a project team, we:
a) Promise to respect each other's ideas and work.
b) Promise to be active team members and do our fair share of the work as best as we can.
c) Promise to do our work on time or communicate proactively with the team if there will be a delay.
d) Promise to help our fellow team members when they need it.
e) Promise to communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project.
f) This is a nonsense-free project. No nonsense will be tolerated.
Method of communication: GroupMe

Decision making policy: Majority Rule

We will meet as pairs as needed and meet as a group once a week on Sundays.

Expected attendance: Everyone attends all meetings unless unable


If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may have a meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement. If the person still breaks these promises, we will ask Professor Duvall to help find a solution.

Signed by each team member once at the beginning of the project.
