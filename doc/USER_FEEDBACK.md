# Feedback

* We received a lot of great feedback during discussion about our UI/UX. At a high level, a lot of our features are not very intuitive and it is particularly difficult to understand how to create a game

* First, the location of tiles and components are very confusing. They run on different coordinate systems (the Tile index for the tile's location, so a number from 1-10 if it is a 10x10 grid, and the position of the mouse in the scene in pixels for components). This takes a long time to figure out and isn't very intuitive. Further, the user basically has no idea what a pixel location means. A number like 204,350 means very little to the user. Perhaps we can have a hover when the mouse is over the grid in author mode, or a location box in the corner of the screen to indicate to the user where each location is on the screen.
