<h2>Starting Out</h2>

<hr />
<p>After launching the application, you will have options to start, view the help page, or connect to facebook. Connecting to Facebook is a great way to make the game more social, as it will allow you to post to your wall with the offical Voogasalad Facebook page!</p>

<p>Next, you will have an option to either create a new game, or select an existing one. Creating a new game will require you to make a name for it and define its dimensions. If you select a game, however, you can create a new level, play a level, edit a level, or load a saved game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, you will end up with the interface where you can actually play or edit aspects of a game or level.</p>

<h2>How to Create a Game</h2>

<hr />
<p>Games are comprised of Levels. You can create a game in the Start menu by selecting &quot;New Game&quot; and subsequently building the first level. After reaching the final interface, there are of aspects you can edit and you have the freedom to build the wackiest game you could ever want.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Click on the Settings button in the bottom right corner to view a variety of options, like viewing/editing the Rules.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Basic Definitions</h2>

<hr />
<p>Game: a game is a sequence of levels strung together. A game has an end condition, as defined by the rules of the game (more on this later).</p>

<p>Level: a level is exactly what you expect: a level of a game. In a level, you might have components spawning and moving on tiles, some towers shooting them, or anything else you may want.</p>

<p>Tile: Tiles are the square-like objects on the canvas (the main part of the screen) that act as the ground of everything moving on top of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Component: We distinguish here between Tiles and Component. A Component, loosely speaking, is anything on the screen that isn&#39;t a tile. This can be a tower that shoots other components. This can been some component, like an enemy, that moves across the Tiles. You can determine what a Component is by looking at and editing its attributes.</p>

<p>Attribute: Tiles and Components have Attributes, which define how they function and interact with the rest of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spawn Timeline: In this tab, you can determine when Components spawn by assigning them to a Timeline. Each Timeline has a unique name, and you can assign a Timeline to a Tile. So if, in Timeline1, you assign a balloon component to Single Instance Spawns with a value of 5, and then assign Tile A to Timeline1 (by editing Tile A&#39;s attributes), after 5 seconds, the balloon will spawn on this Tile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Author/Player mode: These are the two modes of the game. In Author, you have the freedom to change and do whatever you want. In Player mode, this isn&#39;t the case. In Player mode, you can only play the game, and you have access to whatever your access permissions dictate.</p>

<p>Access Permissions define when a Component or Tile can be &quot;accessed.&quot; You can determine if its accessible in author player mode, in certain games, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Adding Components and Tiles</h2>

<hr />
<p>Preset Components and Tiles can be clicked-and-dragged onto the grid from the &quot;Preset Bank&quot; at the bottom of the application window. You can also create your own Component or Tile from scratch by pressing the &quot;+&quot; button in those &quot;Preset Banks&quot;.</p>

<p>Cool Tips!</p>

<ul>
	<li>Holding down the Space Bar in Author mode shows which &quot;Mode Directions&quot; each Tile contains</li>
	<li>Holding &quot;Control&quot;, clicking a set of Tiles, and then draggin-and-dropping a preset Tile on the selected Tiles will replace all those Tiles with the preset</li>
	<li>Holding &quot;Control&quot;, clicking a set of Tiles, and then pressing an arrow key on your keyboard will change the &quot;Move Directions&quot; that each of those Tiles contains</li>
	<li>Right click on a presetin the Palette to remove them from the Palette</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Switching Modes and Access Permissions</h2>

<hr />
<p>At any time, click on the switch in the corner to change from Author to Player mode, and vice versa. This can also be done in settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In each mode, you will only have be able to see and use whatever their Access Permissions dictate (as stated before), so be careful when creating Tiles and Components.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
